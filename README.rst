Hacking? NetHacking?

It's “Hackn”! Yes, yet another NetHack clone, using NCurses!

Overview:
=========

Hackn is a NetHack clone, of sorts, written to use the NCurses library.
It includes a (currently small) wrapper to make NCurses nicer to use
from C++. The wrapper is contained in the ``nc.h`` header.

Actually, this was created as a project to learn NCurses, not the other
way around, but I’m currently planning on continuing development anyway.

Hackn and the NCurses wrapper are written using some C++11
functionality, which make some things much nicer, so you will need a
recent version of GCC (Hackn currently compiles with g++ 4.6.3, so it
doesn’t need to be bleeding edge).

Current Status:
===============

So alpha, it’s practically omega! (I’m positive no one’s **ever** used
*that* joke before!)
